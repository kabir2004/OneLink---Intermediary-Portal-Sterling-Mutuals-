## Project Structure
- `src/pages` – Application routes (dashboard, KYP, analytics, etc.)
- `src/components` – Reusable UI and layout components
- `src/data` – Sample data for dashboards and KYP flows
- `src/context` – Auth provider for global sign-out
- `public` – Static assets

## Deployment
The project builds to a static bundle and can be hosted on any CDN or static host:

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Upload the `dist/` directory to your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).
3. Configure the site root to serve from `dist/`.

For Git-based platforms (e.g., Vercel/Netlify), point the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `dist/`.
